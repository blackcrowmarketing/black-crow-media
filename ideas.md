# Black Crow Media - Design Brainstorming

## 1. The "Brutalist Terminal" Aesthetic
<response>
<text>
**Design Movement:** Neo-Brutalism / Cyberpunk
**Core Principles:** Raw, functional, developer-focused, high-contrast.
**Color Philosophy:** Monochromatic (Black/White) with a single electric accent (Neon Green or Cyber Yellow). Represents the "code-first" nature of the Agency OS.
**Layout Paradigm:** Grid-heavy, visible borders, modular "cards" that look like terminal windows.
**Signature Elements:** Monospace typography, blinking cursors, raw HTML elements styled as UI.
**Interaction Philosophy:** Instant feedback, keyboard-driven navigation hints, "command line" style inputs.
**Animation:** Glitch effects on hover, typewriter text reveal, sharp transitions (no ease-in-out).
**Typography System:** JetBrains Mono (Headings & Body) - Pure code aesthetic.

## Selected Approach: The "Brutalist Terminal" Aesthetic
**Reasoning:** This style perfectly aligns with the "Agency OS" concept—it's for power users, developers, and those who want to "hack" the agency model. It differentiates Black Crow Media (the product) from Black Crow Marketing (the service), which likely uses a more standard corporate style. It screams "technical authority."
